/* ==========================================================
   demo.js — the guest's demo data. A guest never sees Nolan's own
   timetable, grades or faculty: index.html loads this file INSTEAD of
   data.js and eval.js, so it defines exactly the same globals with the
   same shapes (SUBJECTS, CLASSES, FACULTY, EVENTS, TERMS, CALENDAR,
   ADVICE, TASKS, GENERAL_TASKS and GRADING). See data.js and eval.js for
   what each field means.
   Everything here is invented: a second year of Computer Science at a
   made-up university, with @example.edu addresses.
   It is ALWAYS ALIVE: the site is a portfolio visited on any day, so no
   date is written by hand. At load time the term is placed around today
   (it started on the Monday three weeks before this week's, so today is
   always in week 4 of 14), and every class, graded date and holiday is
   computed from that. Today, the next 7 days, the planner and Exams
   therefore always have something to show, on a weekday or a weekend.
   core.js loads after this file, so its date helpers (addDays, isoDate…)
   do not exist yet: these are our own, prefixed demo_ because every
   top-level name here is global and must not clash with later scripts.
